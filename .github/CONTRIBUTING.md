Thank you for taking the time to help this project grow.

This project is still in its early development, so this guide might change in the future.

**I found a bug**

First, check the existing issues to make sure that you don't create a new issue that we already know about.

Then, gather as much information as you can to make sure we can reproduce and understand this bug.

When you have enough information, create a new ticket with the **`bug`** label.

Leave all your gathered information in the description of the ticket, and submit it.

If you decide to update the bug's description later on, please do not delete parts of the description, just cross them out ~~like this~~ with two ~~ charaacters on both sides of the redacted text. If you update something, please also leave a comment about it.

**I would like request a new feature**

First, check the tickets for any existing similar feature requests. If you find one, please leave a comment to indicate that you would like to see this feature as well. This helps us prioritize feature requests, plus you can leave your opinion on the matter for us to consider.

If you have a completely new idea, you can create a new issue with the **`feature-request`** label. In the issue's description describe the feature as precisely as you can to make sure that we understand your request.

If you decide to update the feature request's description later on, please do not delete parts of the description, just cross them out ~~like this~~ with two ~~ charaacters on both sides of the redacted text. If you update something, please also leave a comment about it.

**I want to contribute**

If you have created a bug or a feature request and you are willing to help developing it, please add a **`let-me-contribute`** label as well. This is important so you don't start developing a feature or a fix that we are already working on.

If we are not working on it yet, we will let you know in a comment, and you will be free to fork the project and start working on it.

When you are done with development, please open a PR, and request code review. Don't forget to link the issue to the PR!

Thank you for helping us with this project!
